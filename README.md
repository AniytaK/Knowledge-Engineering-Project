# Knowledge-Engineering-Project

The project process involved the selection of suitable Linked Open Data sources, including DBpedia and WikiData. Subsequently, data was carefully cleaned and transformed, followed by the application of web scraping techniques to extract detailed information from UAS websites. The creation of a specific ontology and the execution of SPARQL queries played a central role. The project results were visualized in an interactive dashboard that offers prospective students and potential employers a user-friendly map with detailed information on different study programs and UAS locations.
